I’m Sneha, a fourth-year PhD student at the [Centre for Linguistic Science & Technology](https://www.iitg.ac.in/clst/index.php), IIT Guwahati, jointly supervised by [Prof. Shakuntala Mahanta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BxCCRB0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Neeraj Kumar Sharma](https://neerajww.github.io/). My path runs from an English literature honours (University of Calcutta) to an MA in Linguistics (EFLU Hyderabad), and now into speech science and machine learning.

My research asks a simple question with tricky consequences: how do learners acquire sound patterns in their native language without explicit instruction? To probe this, I treat modern deep models as proxy “infants,” learning from raw audio without labels. Using unsupervised and self-supervised deep learning models, I test what information these models actually use, when they succeed or fail, and whether their learning dynamics rhyme with human acquisition.

India’s linguistic diversity makes it an ideal stress-test: I focus on low-resource settings and under-documented phenomena in Indian languages, evaluating whether state-of-the-art systems can generalize reliably when data are thin, and what that reveals about the signals humans might exploit.

You can browse current and in-progress work [here](), and a few things I make or notice when I’m not debugging code, I like finding form and pattern—whether in spectra, sentences, or street corners[[more]()].
