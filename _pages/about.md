I’m Sneha, a fourth-year PhD student at the Centre for Linguistic Science & Technology, IIT Guwahati, jointly supervised by Prof. Shakuntala Mahanta and Dr. Neeraj Kumar Sharma. My path runs from an English literature honours (University of Calcutta) to an MA in Linguistics (EFLU Hyderabad), and now into speech science and machine learning.

My research asks a simple question with tricky consequences: how do learners acquire sound patterns in their native language without explicit instruction? To probe this, I treat modern deep models as proxy “infants,” learning from raw audio without labels. Using Featural InfoWaveGAN (Begus 2021) and Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al. 2017), I test what information these models actually use, when they succeed or fail, and whether their learning dynamics rhyme with human acquisition.

India’s linguistic diversity makes it an ideal stress-test: I focus on low-resource settings and under-documented phenomena in Indian languages, evaluating whether state-of-the-art systems can generalize reliably when data are thin, and what that reveals about the signals humans might exploit.

You can browse current and in-progress work [Projects](), and a few things I make or notice when I’m not debugging code, I like finding form and pattern—whether in spectra, sentences, or street corners[see more]().
